        BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to
        adult men and women.

        <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
        <p>
          Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation used to assess a
          person's body weight in relation to their height. It's calculated by
          dividing an individual's weight (in kilograms) by the square of their
          height (in meters). BMI is commonly used as a general indicator of
          whether someone is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
        </p>
        <p>The BMI categories are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Underweight: BMI less than 18.5</li>
          <li>Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9</li>
          <li>Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9</li>
          <li>Obesity: BMI 30 or greater</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Limitations of BMI</h3>
        <p>
          While BMI is widely used, it has some limitations. It doesn't
          differentiate between muscle mass and fat mass, so individuals with
          high muscle mass (such as athletes) may be classified as overweight or
          obese even though they have low body fat. Additionally, BMI doesn't
          consider fat distribution, which is an important factor in assessing
          health risks. It also doesn't account for differences in body
          composition due to age, gender, or ethnicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a more comprehensive assessment of health, BMI should be used
          alongside other measurements, such as waist-to-hip ratio or body fat
          percentage.
